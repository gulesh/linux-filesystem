# HW7
### Gulesh, Ivan, and Mohamed

## Compilation
Compile the shell link to library using **make**. remove excuetables with make clean.
Explore other shortcuts for compiling the library, the shell, and the format utility 
separately in the Makefile. Run using ./mysh. Compile the format utility using make format. 
Run using ./format.exec.
## Basic Structure
A 1 mb disk is present and is mounted automatically. The disk contains the root mount point, 
a directory inside it named usr, and a sample test file inside usr called file.text.
The structure of the file system is very similar to the disk from HW6, with 10 direct blocks, 
4 singly indirect, 1 doubly and one triply. The signatures of the library functions are 
shown below.
```
int f_open(char * , int);
int f_read(int, int, void* );
int f_write(void *, int, int );
int f_opendir(char * );
dentry *f_readdir(int );
int f_mkdir(char * );
int f_rmdir(char * );
void init_library(char *);
void close_library();
```
We keep 3 global data structures shared between the shell and the library
